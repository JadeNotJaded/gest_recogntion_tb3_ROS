This file is still a work in progress, the idea is that we would save images from the Kinect as pngs, put them through the
model and then send an instruction. We know that the model is very accurate as we have tested it on many images from this
repository https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog. However, we decided to use leap motion as our infrared sensor once 
we realized it was available to us. 

We believe that the model work perfectly witht the leap motion since we are using the same device to record the images and 
train the model.
